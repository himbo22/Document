# What’s an IP address?

An IP (internet protocol) address is a numerical identifier. The computer network to which it is assigned uses it to communicate with the outside world. It’s also used to identify a host or network interface and display its location. IP addresses can be both public and private.

# What’s a public IP address?

ISPs (internet service providers) generally assign each network and the associated router a public address. It’s used to establish a connection to the internet and communicate outside of your own network. As such, it’s required for you to go online.

The public address is accessible from around the world and helps other devices communicate with your network. In short, a public IP address ensures content from websites, emails, and streaming providers as well as other data from the internet is correctly forwarded to you. Thankfully, you can protect your personal data when communicating with other networks with a browser safety add-on. Among other things, it blocks intrusive ads and prevents companies from tracking what you do online.

# What’s a private IP address?

The network router assigns a private IP address to the devices connected to it. This allows devices from the same network to communicate and interact with each other — all without connecting to the internet. With the help of private IP addresses, a router can forward data traffic on its own network.

This means private addresses help to increase security within a network. To give a practical example: When using your wireless connection at home, you can send documents from your computer to your printer for printing — all without the risk of outsiders gaining access to them.

# How do private and public IP addresses differ?

A public IP address is unique and visible to everyone. It ensures that you can be clearly identified on the internet. By contrast, a private IP address is only used within a private network. This allows the devices within a network to connect securely to one another.

The main difference between public and private IP addresses is the scope: A public, external IP address is visible globally. By contrast, a private, internal IP address sits locally within a specific address range. All private networks in the world include devices assigned private, local IP addresses from the following ranges:

- Class A:0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
- Class B:16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
- Class C:168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

These IP addresses are reserved for use on private networks. This means they can be reused within different local networks worldwide without any risk of confusion.

# How can I tell what my IP address is?

Both your public and private IP addresses are required for your devices to connect to the internet. Once connected, your private IP address is replaced by the public IP address which your ISP assigns to your network. This protects other devices on your network and allows you to go online with them too. In the following, you’ll learn how to find out what your IP address is.

# How to find out what your public IP address is

The easiest way to find out what your public IP address is to search for it using a search engine. Simply enter a search term such as “What is my IP address?” You’ll then be shown tools you can use to discover your public IP address. Internet service providers change your public IP address — something they do regularly when they assign you a public, dynamic IP address. Theoretically, this can change every 24 hours.
