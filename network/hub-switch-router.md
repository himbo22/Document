1. Hub :

A Hub is just a connector that connects the wires coming from different sides. There is no signal processing or regeneration. It is an electronic device that operates only on physical layers of the OSI model.

It is also known as a repeater as it transmits signal to every port except the port from where signal is received. Also, hubs are not that intelligent in communication and processing information for 2nd and 3rd layer.

2. Switch :

Switch is a point to point communication device. It operates at the data link layer of OSI model. It uses switching table to find out the correct destination.

Basically, it is a kind of bridge that provides better connections. It is a kind of device that set up and stop the connections according to the requirements  needed at that time. It comes up with many features such as flooding, filtering and frame transmission.

3. Router :

Routers are the multiport devices and more sophisticated as compared to repeaters and bridges. It contains a routing table that enables it to make decision about the route i.e. to determine which of several possible paths between the source and destination is the best for a particular transmission.

It works on the network layer 3 and used in LANs, MANs and WANs. It stores IP address and maintains address on its own.
