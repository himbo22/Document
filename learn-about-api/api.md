# What is an API?

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

# What does API stand for?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

# How do APIs work?

API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client. 

There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.

**SOAP APIs**
These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.

**RPC APIs**
These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.

**Websocket APIs**
Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.

**REST APIs**
These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. Let’s look at REST APIs in more detail below.

# What are REST APIs?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.

# What is web API?

A Web API or Web Service API is an application processing interface between a web server and web browser. All web services are APIs but not all APIs are web services. REST API is a special type of Web API that uses the standard architectural style explained above.

The different terms around APIs, like Java API or service APIs, exist because historically, APIs were created before the world wide web. Modern web APIs are REST APIs and the terms can be used interchangeably.

# What are API integrations?

API integrations are software components that automatically update data between clients and servers. Some examples of API integrations are when automatic data sync to the cloud from your phone image gallery, or the time and date automatically sync on your laptop when you travel to another time zone. Enterprises can also use them to efficiently automate many system functions.

# What are the benefits of REST APIs?

REST APIs offer four main benefits:

1. Integration 
APIs are used to integrate new applications with existing software systems. This increases development speed because each functionality doesn’t have to be written from scratch. You can use APIs to leverage existing code.

2. Innovation 
Entire industries can change with the arrival of a new app. Businesses need to respond quickly and support the rapid deployment of innovative services. They can do this by making changes at the API level without having to re-write the whole code.

3. Expansion
APIs present a unique opportunity for businesses to meet their clients’ needs across different platforms. For example, maps API allows map information integration via websites, Android,iOS, etc. Any business can give similar access to their internal databases by using free or paid APIs.

4. Ease of maintenance
The API acts as a gateway between two systems. Each system is obliged to make internal changes so that the API is not impacted. This way, any future code changes by one party do not impact the other party.

# What are the different types of APIs?

APIs are classified both according to their architecture and scope of use. We have already explored the main types of API architectures so let’s take a look at the scope of use.

**Private APIs**
These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting systems and data within the business.

**Public APIs**
These are open to the public and may be used by anyone. There may or not be some authorization and cost associated with these types of APIs.

**Partner APIs** 
These are only accessible by authorized external developers to aid business-to-business partnerships.

**Composite APIs** 
These combine two or more different APIs to address complex system requirements or behaviors. 

# What is an API endpoint and why is it important?

API endpoints are the final touchpoints in the API communication system. These include server URLs, services, and other specific digital locations from where information is sent and received between systems. API endpoints are critical to enterprises for two main reasons: 

1. Security
API endpoints make the system vulnerable to attack. API monitoring is crucial for preventing misuse.

2. Performance
API endpoints, especially high traffic ones, can cause bottlenecks and affect system performance.

# How to secure a REST API?

All APIs must be secured through proper authentication and monitoring. The two main ways to secure REST APIs include:

1. Authentication tokens 
These are used to authorize users to make the API call. Authentication tokens check that the users are who they claim to be and that they have access rights for that particular API call. For example, when you log in to your email server, your email client uses authentication tokens for secure access.

2. API keys 
API keys verify the program or application making the API call. They identify the application and ensure it has the access rights required to make the particular API call. API keys are not as secure as tokens but they allow API monitoring in order to gather data on usage. You may have noticed a long string of characters and numbers in your browser URL when you visit different websites. This string is an API key the website uses to make internal API calls.
